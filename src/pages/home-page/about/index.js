            Since its establishment in 2014, The Raya Clinic has offered its
            clients products and services to enable them to live their lives
            fully well. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we became one of the
            first and most preferred COVID-19 Testing providers in Metro Manila,
            serving various companies and institutions like Huawei, Hewlett
            Packard Philippines, and the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The
            Raya Clinicâ€™s medical staff are trained and equipped with the proper
            knowledge to carry out a safe and proper administration of the
            Moderna vaccine. We have the capacity to vaccinate 100,000 patients
            per month, or potentially scale depending on your requirements.
